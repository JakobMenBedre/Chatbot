# Chatbot
A very easy to make chatbot. not very advanced.
first of all you need the webbrowser import. Though i think that is preinstalled into python 3
ok so the chatbot is a simple chatbot which will only respond with information when you say the correct messages. otherwise it will tell you that "there is a little error". basically it works like this: first of all there is a dictionary with messages and answers. and then as the main program it makes you do a input and it will save whatever you write in a variable called "skrive". Then a new variable is made, which is called "inskrive" that takes the value from "skrive" but makes is lowercase. and then it searches for the value in "inskrive" in the dictionary, and if it finds a match it will print the coresponding answer. but if it can't find a match it will say that "there is a little error" dont worry about the rest. 

you can make chatbot by having a dictionary, and a variable gets its values from a input. and then look for the value of the imput in the dictionary and print the coresponding answer.
